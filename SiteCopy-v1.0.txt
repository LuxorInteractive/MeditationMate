Meditation is a word that gets thrown around a lot lately
But what does it really mean?
How do you really do it?
And how do you even know if you're successful?

There are a lot of questions, and even more opinions.
You could shave your head, move to Tibet, and study with a monk
Or… you can monitor your progress right at home!

We've taken the newest technology, combined it with years of research
and packaged it all together. The approach is simple, exact, and gives real results.

Unlike other systems, with Meditation Mate 
you will have access to your body statistics like heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and many more.



Measure stress levels before and after meditation,
keep track of meditation depth,
set goals and keep track.

Whether you're looking to improve your cardiovascular activity,
attain deeper levels of trance,
or just reduce stress… 
we'll help you understand it from A to Z
